# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer using three distinct datasets and various machine learning algorithms. We aim to leverage the power of data analysis and machine learning to assist in the early detection and classification of breast tumors as benign or malignant.
